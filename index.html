        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives the content structure.</li>
      <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
      <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
      <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). </li>
      <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. </li>
      <li>The src element attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. </li>
      <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
      <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. </li>
      <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link. </li>
      <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
      <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</b>gives the content style</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, and External CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page,</li> 
        <li>and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. </li>
        <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
